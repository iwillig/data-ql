# data-ql

This project is a Clojure based GraphQL implementation. The goal is to
provide a light-weight collection of tools that allows you to build a
complex GraphQL API in the Clojure language.

This project is similar in scope as Lacina, but takes a different
approach to both parsing, schema definition and execution engine.

A key difference is the use of
[manifold](https://github.com/clj-commons/manifold)
